      <h2> My Experience </h2>
      <br>
      <br>

      <p>I'm a 4th Year Computer Science and Mathematics major at UCSD,
        with an expected graduation date of April 2021.<br>
        During my time here, I've taken advantage of several student
        leadership opportunities, and also spent some time<br>
        honing my technical skills outside of class.
        Below is a full rundown of my experience at UCSD.<br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
     <u>Web Developer Intern: October 2020 - December 2020</u><br>Construction Management Association of America<br>
     <br>
     I revamped the organization’s home website with the guidance of a senior web developer using Drupal.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>


     <u>Freelance Web Developer: October 2018 - March 2019</u><br> Multicultural Greek Council<br>
     <br>
     I developed websites, using WordPress and Wix, for the events organized by UCSD campus Greek life.<br>
     These events mainly consisted of fundraisers, and I also developed stylish homepages for many of the orgs.<br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>


     <u>Residential Advisor and Assistant: March 2019 - April 2020</u><br>
       John Muir College Residential Life<br>

     <br>
     I Managed Tioga residential hall, which housed about ~1,000 undergraduate students, mostly first years.<br>
      Working with a team of 10 RAs, I mediated and resolved all conflicts and disagreements between students on a daily basis,<br>
     and organized and hosted multiple weekly events and team-building activities for the residents specifically on my floor, including<br>
     trips to the beach, hikes, movie showings, educational presentations and more.
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>


     <u>Campus Tour Guide and Ambassador: January 2019 - August 2020</u><br>
     UCSD Admissions Office<br>
     <br>
      After a 10-week intensive training period during which I memorized a 40-page script on details and trivia about the University,<br>
      I presented hundreds of walking tours to thousands of tourists and prospective students from all over the world. <br>
      When we weren't giving tours, we were involved with student outreach, calling hundreds of current and prospective students<br>
      to resolve any questions or issues they had regarding the University. During the pandemic, we handled crisis management<br>
      with all of the recently admitted students through these calling campaigns.
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>
     <br>


    <u>Orientation Leader: October 2018 - September 2018</u><br>
    John Muir College<br>
     <br>
     I assisted the staff in welcoming new students and their families, and introduced them to life at the college. <br>
     I hosted Q&A sessions answering a variety of parents’ questions and was a positive role model for the freshmen, <br>
     teaching them useful skills both in and out of the classroom.

        <h3> Full-Stack Video Game Dev</h3>
        <p> Coded a web Tetris game from scratch, using JavaScript, HTML and CSS
            Special thanks to Ania Kubow for the extensive YouTube walkthrough tutorial
            <br>
            <br>
            Tetris is one of my all time favorite games, and I had no experience with JavaScript
            before starting this project, so it was very insightful, her profile be found here at

          Coded a web sudoku-solver, using JavaScript, and a backtracking algorithm I learned in my CSE 101: Advanced Algorithms class<br>
          <br>
          Special thanks to Jack He for helping me with the front end of the project, and how to display it on a browser.

        <h3> Data Structures in a Day</h3>
        <p> Made an educational, Algorithms "cheat sheet" website to help me study
           while also developing my understanding of HTML and CSS. <br>
           <br>
           Since the CS content of the website was fairly basic (big O runtimes and standard
            operations like insert, delete) I decided to add a video of myself at the top of the page where I explain a simple CS concept
            (extracting last letter of a string)to an audience with no CS experience <br>
           <br>
           The website originally used a template called basic 89, but I changed the style, and added additional components like pictures,
            headings, and additional containers for extra data structures <br>

    <div class="Interests">
      <h2> Personal Interests </h2>
      <br>
      <p>Here are some things I enjoy doing with my free time:</p>
      <br>
      <u>Volunteer Tutoring</u>
      <br>
      - During high school, as a Lead AP ambassador, I tutored for all the AP classes (9 total)
        I took. I spent hours tutoring struggling students during lunch and afterschool, and I developed
         a great relationship with all my teachers, who confirmed with me
         that my one-on-one time with the struggling students had been making a difference, and that their grades had improved.
         While I haven't held a formal tutoring position since then, I attribute my communication skills, as well
         as my passion for learning to this position. By the end of High School, I had accumulated seversl hundreds of tutoring hours. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <u>Hiking</u>
      <br>
      - I've been hiking since early high school, and in Riverside, we have a hiking
      trail a couple miles from my house called Skyline: a trail that leads up to one of the biggest hills/mountains in Riverside.
      When I was on the Tennis team in high school, we used to train cardio by sprinting up this trail. When I was in college, I never
      gave up on this activity, and would continue to hike the trails near campus, Scripps, La Jolla Shores, and Blacks beach<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <u>Surfing</u>
      <br>
      - As UCSD has been named #1 surfing school in the world, it would've been insane for me to never once have tried Surfing during my time there.
      I was lucky enough that each year at UCSD, I had a friend or floormate/roomate that was willing to not only teach me how to surf, but also
      let me borrow their surfboard regularly. Although I am still very much a beginner at this sport/activity, I look forward to getting my own board
      and catching some waves, whenver resrictions roll back and I can comfortably return to the shores.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <u>Kayaking</u>
      <br>
      - Similarly to surfing, kayaking is an activity I only picked up in college. In La Jolla Shores, there are several rental shops
      for kayaks and other such gear, and about once a quarter, my friends and I would rent one and kayak around La Jolla Shores/La Jolla Cove. <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <u>Breaking Bad and Better Call Saul</u>
      <br>
      - My favorite series of all time. I have rewatched both shows several times, and I am very eagerly awaiting the end of Better Call Saul<br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <br>
      <u>Tetris</u>
      <br>
      - I play many video games in general (on my PlayStation 4), and Tetris is one of the earliest games I have ever learned to play
      (about as early as I could use a keyboard). A game called "Tetris Effect" released on the PS4 a few years ago, and I have mastered the game so well, that I consistently reached the top
      .5% of all player scores. Though I haven't had much free time to play in a while, this is a game I will always come back to, and never get tired of<br>
